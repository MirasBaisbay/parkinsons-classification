# parkinsons-classification

A project that classifies Parkinson's Disease using the Kaggle dataset. Implemented Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting and Random Forest classifier, which both resulted in an 87\% accuracy on the testing dataset. Fine-tuned the model using GridSearchCV significantly increased the F1-score for class 0 from 0.71 to 0.92 and maintained the same 0.92 F1-score for class 1
